Fear Yourself is one of my first individual school projects. It's made in Unity in a handfull of weeks. 

In Fear Yourself, the player must complete the same level three times in a row. Twist: The player's path is saved and enemies are walking along the path backwards. 
If the player touches the enemies, the level restarts. Player have to plan out every path and think about future paths. The faster the player completes the level, the higher the score.
